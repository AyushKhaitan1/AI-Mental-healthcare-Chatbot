🩺 AI Healthcare Chatbot📸 Project PreviewHome ScreenDiagnostic ReportUser Interface & SidebarAI-Generated Medical AnalysisSymptom-Based Disease Prediction using Random Forest: This project is an interactive healthcare solution that bridges the gap between Machine Learning and User-Centric Design.Diagnostic Reports: It uses a trained Random Forest Classifier to analyze user symptoms and provide a preliminary diagnostic report, complete with disease descriptions and actionable precautions.🌟 Key FeaturesIntelligent Symptom Mapping: Uses difflib and keyword processing to map user-friendly symptom names to machine-readable data.High-Accuracy Classifier: Employs a Random Forest Model with 300 estimators, trained on a comprehensive dataset of medical patterns.Dynamic Data Loading: Loads medical descriptions and precautions directly from master CSV files to provide context-aware responses.Interactive Chat UI: A clean Streamlit interface with a persistent sidebar for patient profiling and symptom selection.Safety First: Includes automated disclaimers and "Model Confidence" scores to ensure users understand the tool is for demonstration purposes.🛠️ Technical StackFrontend: Streamlit (Python).Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier, Label Encoding).Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy.Natural Language: difflib for robust symptom matching.📊 Dataset & ModelTraining.csv: Contains patterns for various diseases and their associated symptoms.symptom_Description.csv: Provides formal definitions for conditions like Malaria, Diabetes, and Hypertension.symptom_precaution.csv: Offers four levels of recommended actions for each predicted condition.Model Logic: The model uses 300 estimators (trees) in a Random Forest ensemble to ensure stable and reliable predictions even with complex symptom overlaps.📂 Repository Structurestreamlit_app.py: The main application file containing the UI logic and ML engine.Data/: Contains Training.csv and Testing.csv used for model development.MasterData/:symptom_Description.csv: Detailed definitions of conditions.symptom_precaution.csv: Specific steps to take for each diagnosis.Symptom_severity.csv: Weights for different symptoms..gitignore: Configured to exclude heavy virtual environments (venv/) and local caches.💻 Installation & SetupClone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/AyushKhaitan1/AI-Mental-healthcare-Chatbot.gitcd AI-Mental-healthcare-ChatbotSet Up Virtual Environment:python -m venv venvWindows: venv\Scripts\activateMac/Linux: source venv/bin/activateInstall Dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txtRun the Application:streamlit run streamlit_app.py⚠️ Medical DisclaimerPurpose: This AI tool is for educational and portfolio purposes only.Not Medical Advice: The results provided are based on statistical patterns and should not be considered professional medical advice.Emergency Contact: In case of an emergency, please contact your local healthcare provider immediately.
